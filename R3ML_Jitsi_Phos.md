# R3ML Jitsi Phos: 50 Years of Computer Programming

The screenshots (Figure 1 and figure 2) below comprises practices in computer programming than span over half a century, from the Forth programming language in 1968, to the latest React Redux Jitsi Meet video conferencing app written in JavaScript.

We do not do this to show off programming acrobatics. We believe the Reverse Polish Notation / Stack Machine as immortalized by Forth is the best way to flatten the learning curves which have been steepened by decades of ___unnecessary complications___ in programming languages perhaps more plentiful than virus species as well as run away frameworks as clueless as flies over corpses. 

We begin our explanation with the following code added to lines 3 to 6 in  `conference.js` in the top directory of `jitsi-meet` repository:

```js
import Phos from "./phos/phos.js";

window.S = []
window.S.push(new Phos())
```

Figure 3 below shows the location of the code above in the file `conference.js` viewed in `gedit`.
