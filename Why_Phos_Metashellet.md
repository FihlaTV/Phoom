# Why Phos Metashellet?


### Metaprogramming

Understanding of stack machine programming helps breakdown algorithms into smaller steps and components, as we know the fundamental building blocks that anything can be broken down to. 

If a programmer is not familiar with stack machine programming, his solution or design to break down an algorithm can further be broken down into stack machine functions, by someone familiar with stack machine programming, as any function can be broken down to stack machine functions.

When a high level complex algorithm is broken down to stack machine functions, the stack machine primitive functions are fundamental, hence easier to use them to compose other useful composite functions. 

Most importantly, stack machine functions can be composed interactively in Metashellet, which high level programming language functions cannot. Hence productivity and efficiency. 


### Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface

Stack Machine Shell (Smashlet) is a shell interface for any programming language, implementing Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface.

Smashlet is definition, what it is. Metashellet is alias, what Smashlet can DO. 

Smashlet programming means stack machine shell programming. 


### Delta Encoding

Just take static background image, and substract scene with moving human to get foreground. Easiest.

Highlight philosophy to let anyone contribute code. 

Make Phos script to compare Python, C++ and JavaScript, Wasm OpenCV performances.

Get static background

Then send only frame deltas. Recipient reconstruct images using only deltas, no background. 


### Parameter Setup

Conventional programming languages do not have facilities to simplify API, or the mechanism of simplifying API is too cumbersome, not worthwhile. Best way to learn Phos Forth colon definition. Then let programmers decide what is the best. Even one parameter can cause delay in finding documentation, or additional requirements in personnel with necessary expertise. One confirmed good example saves a lot of time of trying to work it out. Starting from unknown vs. known conditions are asymmetric efforts. 

Use one word to define one parameter, save as global variable or object property variable. In main function, check parameters, if undefined, use default. Standard API in conventional programming languages do not have defaults and no one has created a method to specify them. 

Most important feature of shellet is RPN interactiveness, not possible in most conventional programming languages.


### Odds of Discovering Delta Encoding Earlier

Ask readers, what are the odds of someone discovers video delta encoding to be used in augmented reality?


### Training for All

Hu Ningxin to Nobody. 

Aims at senior to junior.

### Training for All

From Hu Ningxin to Nobody. 

Computer vision has been perceived as a "hard" area in computer programming, in that most "mortal" "web & app developers" who have often "downloaded and modified"  Android projects from github, may have given up on it due to the complexity of the mathematics concerned, or the computational demand of the algorithms which the poor browser or mobile phone fail to deliver.

Article aims at both senior and novice developers. Senior can help develop upstream of Phoom. Junior can learn downstream, then develop upstream.

Companies need YAHUDI strategy to get best benefits of both world:
- faster and easier training for junior developers;
- faster and easier transition for senior developers to new programming languages, tools and platforms.

Here's a short Python RPN I wrote for Python turtle module, just to show you and primary school teachers and students that RPN can be used from elementary logo turtle graphics programming to computer algebra, and of course, as a universal script to interface to all programming languages, in short, a universal script for programming and mathematics:
