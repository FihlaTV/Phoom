# Why Phos Metashellet?

<!--
Must write in introduction, how many sections there are in this article, how are they related.

There should not be more than 5 main points. Too many, then split into smaller articles.

Must number them. Order is also important.
-->

1. delta encoding. Needs recursive setTimeout.

Explain technical issue first, then teamwork (metaprogramming etc.) and bigger issues

2. Metaprogramming: follow up from example code: src gray blur

3. Recruit and train up teams of senior and junior programmers to develop Phoom. 

4. Highlight vision of projects A to Z. Inter-game communications, 3D next generation social networks.



## A. Delta Encoding

### What are the odds of someone discovers video delta encoding to be used in augmented reality?

<!-- 
Ask readers, 
- Odds of Discovering Delta Encoding Earlier
- Use comment tag to comment out notes
-->

Just take static background image, and substract scene with moving human to get foreground. Easiest.

Highlight philosophy to let anyone contribute code. 

Make Phos script to compare Python, C++ and JavaScript, Wasm OpenCV performances.

Get static background

Then send only frame deltas. Recipient reconstruct images using only deltas, no background. 


### Recursive `setTimeout`

Need this for high level control of Metashellet (function within loop).

## B. Metaprogramming


### Training for All

Computer vision has been perceived as a "hard" area in computer programming, in that most "mortal" "web & app developers" who have often "downloaded and modified"  Android projects from github, may have given up on it due to the complexity of the mathematics concerned, or the computational demand of the algorithms which the poor browser or mobile phone fail to deliver.

This article aims at both senior and novice developers. Senior can help develop upstream of Phoom. Junior can learn downstream, then develop upstream.

In this article, we demonstrated JavaScript to Phos ....
- White box view -- senior developers
- Black box view -- junior developers

Senior developers need to know black box views and psychology of junior developers too, to make training efficient and effective.

### Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface

Stack Machine Shell (Smashlet) is a shell interface for any programming language, implementing Yet Another Hybrid Upstream Downstream Interface.

Smashlet is definition, what it is. Metashellet is alias, what Smashlet can DO. 

Smashlet programming means stack machine shell programming. 

Companies need YAHUDI strategy to get best benefits of both world:
- faster and easier training for junior developers;
- faster and easier transition for senior developers to new programming languages, tools and platforms.
 
From Hu Ningxin to Nobody. 


### Metaprogramming

Understanding of stack machine programming helps breakdown algorithms into smaller steps and components, as we know the fundamental building blocks that anything can be broken down to. 

If a programmer is not familiar with stack machine programming, his solution or design to break down an algorithm can further be broken down into stack machine functions, by someone familiar with stack machine programming, as any function can be broken down to stack machine functions.

When a high level complex algorithm is broken down to stack machine functions, the stack machine primitive functions are fundamental, hence easier to use them to compose other useful composite functions. 

Most importantly, stack machine functions can be composed interactively in Metashellet, which high level programming language functions cannot. Hence productivity and efficiency. 


### Parameter Setup

Conventional programming languages do not have facilities to simplify API, or the mechanism of simplifying API is too cumbersome, not worthwhile. Best way to learn Phos Forth colon definition. Then let programmers decide what is the best. Even one parameter can cause delay in finding documentation, or additional requirements in personnel with necessary expertise. One confirmed good example saves a lot of time of trying to work it out. Starting from unknown vs. known conditions are asymmetric efforts. 

Use one word to define one parameter, save as global variable or object property variable. In main function, check parameters, if undefined, use default. Standard API in conventional programming languages do not have defaults and no one has created a method to specify them. 

Most important feature of shellet is RPN interactiveness, not possible in most conventional programming languages.

Another way to unify programming languages. Just like wasm wat. But better. 


### Metaprogramming should be grouped together with YAHUDI etc. ...

Metaprogramming = simplifying OpenCV JavaScript

Here's a short Python RPN I wrote for Python turtle module, just to show you and primary school teachers and students that RPN can be used from elementary logo turtle graphics programming to computer algebra, and of course, as a universal script to interface to all programming languages, in short, a universal script for programming and mathematics:
