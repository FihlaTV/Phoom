# Phoom
Phoom VR AR

Some people may relate Phoom to other projects with name suffixed by -oom. Read on the see how we transcend the predecessors.

We believe we are blazing a trail that is inevitable in the evolution of computing technology &mdash; not only combining image processing and virtual (augmented) reality (and of course, artificial intelligence) &mdash; but also synergizing free and open source software development, social networks, shared economies and start-up business.

Imagine an app that extract the face or body of someone dancing, merging the dancing bodies of a dozen or several dozen other dancers, projected into an augmented reality, letting all participants to participate in an AR dance pool &mdash; much like a Zoom session, but in 3D AR.

That is the vision of Phoom.
