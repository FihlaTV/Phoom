# Phoom
Phoom VR AR

Some people may relate Phoom to other projects with name suffixed by -oom. The name Phoom is derived from [Phos Metashellet](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet), one of the core components of Phoom, and the impression of power of the suffix -oom. Read on the see how we transcend the predecessors.

We believe we are blazing a trail that is inevitable in the evolution of computing technology &mdash; not only combining image processing and virtual (augmented) reality (and of course, artificial intelligence) &mdash; but also synergizing free and open source software development, social networks, shared economies and start-up business.

Imagine an app that extract the face or body of someone dancing, merging the dancing bodies of a dozen or several dozen other dancers, projected into an augmented reality, letting all participants to participate in an AR dance pool &mdash; much like a Zoom session, but in 3D AR.

That is the vision of Phoom.

Projects A and B above are two impressive open source OpenCV examples. They represent the kind of projects that give us the confidence to challenge Zoom and which we can use as our building blocks.

However, with projects A and B alone, we cannot overcome the conventional obstacles facing isolated individual programmers in  free software development, resulting in the widening gaps in achievements between teams funded by billion, nay, trillion dollars corporations and teams made up of isolated individual programmers.
